# Sports Ball with React

For this assignment, your task is to build a **React** user interface that cheers your favorite city's sports ball team. Start by forking and cloning this repository to your development environment. Then, in the `sports-ball.html` file, create a React user interface that looks and functions like this.

**HINT:** It's perfectly fine if the initial value of a state property, like `this.state.who`, starts out as an empty string `""`.

## Bonus

Refactor your user interface to handle city names of any case. In other words, treat `SEATTLE`, `seattle`, `SeAtTlE`, etc. all that same.

## Bonus

Once you're satisfied, find a classmate and see if that person would like some help.
